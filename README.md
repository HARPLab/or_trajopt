OpenRAVE prpy bindings for TrajOpt.

This plugin downloads and builds TrajOpt from source and creates a
Python wrapper that interfaces it with the prpy planning API.

All of the normal TrajOpt python bindings are also available when this
package is included in a catkin workspace.

## Dependencies ##
```
$ sudo apt-get install libopenscenegraph-dev cmake libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev python-numpy
```
